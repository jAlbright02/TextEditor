# TextEditor

## Description
This application is a GUI program that allows the user to write text, 
edit font size and family, save and open existing text files.
I wanted to expand my skillset in different aspects of Java and a GUI was something I had not covered in College yet.
I used Java Swing to create this application as it is heavily documented which made it nice to work with.
